# Corel

Corel is a smart computer vision model that identifies facies and performs rock typing on core images. It is based on YOLOv8-Segmentation model that is trained to classify different facies and sedimentary features from core images. The facies include:
* Bioturbated mudstone/sandstone
* Massive mudstone/sandstone
* Parallel-laminated mudstone/sandstone
* Cross-bedded/graded-bedded sandstone
* Current-rippled sandstone
* Conglomerate
* Fissile shale
* Heterolithic

### ðŸ¤– Try Corel --> [HERE](https://github.com/yohanesnuwara/corel/blob/main/notebooks/Corel.ipynb) <-- Upload your own core image (or use example image in folder [core_images](https://github.com/yohanesnuwara/corel/tree/main/core_images))

### Result

The following is example of result of Corel facies classification on core image which can accurately make segmentation for every sedimentary changes such as parallel-laminated sandstone, massive sandstone, etc.
