# Corel

Corel is a smart computer vision model that identifies facies and performs rock typing on core images. It is based on YOLOv8-Segmentation model that is trained to classify different facies and sedimentary features from core images. The facies include:
* Bioturbated mudstone/sandstone
* Massive mudstone/sandstone
* Parallel-laminated mudstone/sandstone
* Cross-bedded/graded-bedded sandstone
* Current-rippled sandstone
* Conglomerate
* Fissile shale
* Heterolithic
